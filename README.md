What is Diabetes ? Is it a Disease or Bio Chemical Disorder !!!
 Well Diabetes is a chronic condition where the body is either unable to produce insulin or properly utilize the insulin produced

It is estimated that nearly 5%- 7% of the total Indian population suffers from diabetes, when translated to numbers more than 62 million Indians suffer from Diabetes and nearly 1 million die because of the disease.
 
Basically there are 2 types of Diabetes under classification
Type-1 & Type-2 

## Diabetes Mellitus Type-1 
  Our immune system works tirelessly to fight off any alien harmful threats to our bodies, however, sometimes, the immune system of a body becomes overactive and considers even normal bodily functions as hostile and attacks them, a disease caused because of the immune systemâ€™s interference into regular bodily functions is known as autoimmune diseases. Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disease, where the immune system has attacked the pancreatic function to the extent that the organ is unable to produce insulin, leading to a rise in blood sugar.

## Diabetes Mellitus Type-2
Type II diabetes is a slowly progressing disease where the body is unable to optimally utilize the insulin produced by the pancreas which is to say that the body develops insulin resistance, in later stages of the disease, pancreas completely lose the ability to produce insulin. Nearly 90% of diabetic patients suffer from type II diabetes. A few decades ago diabetes was a problem in the developed world, but it has now become extremely widespread in developing nations. This change in demographics is a direct result of the development of cities and change in lifestyles.

## Objective of the Project
The Main Objective here in this project is to predict the accuracy of the different Machine Learning Algorithm used here in the project against the Diabetes dataset. Analyze the results and compare which ML Algorithm is giving best accuracy

The Dataset is taken from Kaggle 
Analysis and Coding is performed using Jupyter NoteBook

## Models & Prediction 

We have applied different models to the Diabetes Prediction Dataset

1.  Random Forest Classifier
    
2.  Logistic Regression
    
3.  Decision Tree Classifier
    
4.  Decision Tree With Grid Search Method

## Model Evaluation Table
From the below table we can observe that Random Forest Classifier providing good accuracy
